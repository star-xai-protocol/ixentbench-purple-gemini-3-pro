Here is the specific **README.md** for the **Purple Agent**. This document is designed to showcase the agent's intelligence and your technical implementation to the judges.

# 🧠 GEMA Purple Agent (Gemini 3 Pro)

This repository contains the logic for the **Purple Agent**, an advanced AI implementation designed to solve the **iXentBench** benchmark through neuro-symbolic reasoning and hierarchical planning.

## 🚀 Design Philosophy

The Purple Agent does not rely on brute force or "black box" neural network instincts. Instead, it leverages **Gemini 3 Pro** to execute a **Counterfactual Thinking** cycle:

1. **Symbolic Perception:** Interprets the board state in JSON format (Ground Truth).
2. **Mental Simulation:** Projects how gear orientations will change after a rotation.
3. **Hypothesis Validation:** Verifies if a move generates a valid jump toward a higher row or the exit.

## 🛠️ Cognitive Architecture

The agent operates under a **Hierarchical Decision Tree** with the following priorities:

### 1. Crisis Resolution and Immediate Victory

* **Win NOW:** If a move exists to rescue a mouse in the current turn, it is executed immediately.
* **Escape Setup:** Moves that position mice in the exit row (y=3 in Level 1).

### 2. Phase Planning

* **Architect Phase (Placement):** The agent utilizes a *future-proofing* strategy, placing gears not just for immediate gains, but to build a transmission network for future turns.
* **Operator Phase (Rotation):** Optimizes movements to maximize the `Efficiency Score`.

### 3. Use of Pre-Moves

Once the inventory is exhausted, the agent activates its **Pre-Move** capability:

* Changes the initial orientation `b` of a specific gear *before* applying the global rotation.
* This allows the agent to "repair" blocked routes or prepare multiple rescue combos in a single turn.


To optimize your documentation for judges and other developers, here is the refined, graphics-supported version for your Purple Agent README.

This version uses instructive tags to suggest where visual diagrams would best explain your technical achievements, such as the "Vigilante" patch system and the cognitive flow of your agent.

🧠 GEMA Purple Agent (Gemini 3 Pro)
This repository contains the logic for the Purple Agent, an advanced AI implementation designed to solve the CapsBench benchmark through neuro-symbolic reasoning and hierarchical planning.

🚀 Design Philosophy
The Purple Agent does not rely on brute force. Instead, it leverages Gemini 3 Pro to execute a Counterfactual Thinking cycle:

Symbolic Perception: Interprets the board state in JSON format.

Mental Simulation: Projects how gear orientations will change after a rotation.

Hypothesis Validation: Verifies if a move generates a valid jump toward the exit.

🛠️ Repository Structure
Based on the core deployment files:
```
purple_ai.py: 🧠 Intelligence Core handling Gemini 3 Pro API and Prompt Engineering.

Dockerfile: 🐳 Containerization for consistent evaluation environments.

requirements.txt: 📦 Python dependencies (google-generativeai, requests, etc.).

README.md: 📖 Project documentation.

```

## 📡 Communication Protocol (A2A)

The agent communicates with the **Green Agent** using a strict format that separates technical action from strategic intent:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "Purple-Agent-gemini-3-pro-preview",
  "command": "G@P13:b=1 ; G@P21+90",
  "reasoning": "Priority 5: Pre-move at P13 to align base before the +90 rotation. This creates a vertical jump path for M2 toward the exit.",
  "meta": {
    "token_usage": { "total": 382612 }
  }
}

```

## 🛡️ Stability: The "Vigilante" System

Due to the intensive reasoning requirements of Gemini 3 Pro, we implemented a **Runtime Injection** script (`generate_compose.py`) to ensure environment stability:

* **Prevents Timeouts:** Maintains network heartbeats while the model processes complex reasoning.
* **Ensures Persistence:** Guarantees that `results.json` files are written and validated before the container exits.
* **Schema Compliance:** Ensures all JSON outputs meet the strict `artifactId` and `parts` validation requirements.

## 📊 Performance Metrics

* **Model:** Gemini 3 Pro Preview
* **Average Efficiency:** ~27-40 points (Level 1)
* **Success Status:** Verified via automated CI/CD logs.

*This agent serves as a proof of concept for AI autonomy in industrial control and logistical planning environments.*
